# Filesystem fragmentation visualizer

This simulator graphically describes filesystem fragmentation.
Files are separated by a semicolon (;). Each file has unique single-character name and a size or minus, if the file is to be deleted, separated by comma (,).
This was created for a school project and is made using HTML, JavaScript and a little bit of CSS.

This is available in English and Estonian.
